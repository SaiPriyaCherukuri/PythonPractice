## EXERCISE ##
# 1. Add new print statement - on a new line
#    which says 'We hear you like the color xxx! xxx is a string with color 
# 2. extend the function with another  input parameter 'color', that defaults to 'red'
# 3. Capture the color via an input box as variable:color 
# 4. Change the 'You are xx!' text to say 'you will be xx+1 years old next birthday 
#  adding 1 to the age
# 5. Capitalize first letter of the 'name', and rest are small caps 
# 6. Favorite color should be in lowercase 

def greeting(name, age=28, color='red'):
    #Greets user with 'name' from 'input box' and 'age', if unavailable, default age is used
    # also includes favorite color
    print(f'Hello {name.capitalize()}, you will be {age+1} years old next birthday !')
    print(f'We hear you like the color {color.lower()}')
    
name = input('Enter your name: ')
age = input('Enter your age: ')
color = input ('Enter your favorite color: ')
greeting(name, int(age), color)


# Functions - named notation

 # also includes favorite color 
   
   print(f"Hello {name.capitalize()}, you will be {age+1} next birthday!")
   print(f"We hear you like the color {color.lower()}!")
